            Yin Yoga is a practice of long held poses. Gently come into a pose until you find an edge that
            feels appropriate for your body, and hold there. Place your awareness on your <em>body</em> and <em>breath</em>. If you then
            feel your body is opening up, feel free to move into a fuller expression of the pose. Yoga is never painful.
            Listen to your body and do what feels right for you.
